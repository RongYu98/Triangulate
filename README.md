# Triangulate
*By Jason Shin, Franklin Wang, and Rong Yu*

##Tools We Will Use:
* Google Maps API
* Mongodb for users who want to track where they have been
* MTA/Uber API for transportation
* Geolocation API

##What We Don't Know How to Do:
* Getting the locations of other people you want to meet up with.

##The Plan
* Triangulate is an application that will allow you to find the most
  convenient location for you and your friends to meet up, whether
  it be to grab a bite or watch a movie.

##Potential Ideas
* Find a place that you and your friends can arrive at within a certain
  time frame.
* Find a place that will take the least amount of time for everyone to
  arrive at.
* Live feed of where you and your friends are on a map (using AJAX calls)
* Friend other users
⋅⋅* Use home address if not connected to the app, else
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
⋅⋅* In order to send users' locations, the program will take the current
    location of the user, store it in a database, then your friend will
    be able to access it.
* Have a page where you can invite people (Chatroom of sorts)
